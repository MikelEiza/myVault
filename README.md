# MyVault

MyVault is a very basic web interface to browse secrets from a remote [HashiCorp's Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

It's written in static HTML and Javascript using [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)

There's no intention to add features to configure Vault backend. But will see...

## Demo
You can see a demo in the static web pages of Github in this link [https://yuki.github.io/myVault/login.html](https://yuki.github.io/myVault/login.html)

You must click on the **gear icon** to introduce your Vault server and the default secret path. 

## Features
* Browse all the secrets
* View them
* Edit secrets with a fully Markdown editor (using [Editor.md](https://github.com/pandao/editor.md))
* Save modifications
* Print secrets
* Automatic logout for security reasons

There will be more features in future.

## Dependencies
To use MyVault you will need a fully functional [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) backup with LDAP authentication (other authentications will be added in the future). You could login with Token too.

## How to use it
You can see in [demo](https://yuki.github.io/myVault/login.html) link. If you want to checkout in your local machine, clone the project and get the submodule for the editor:

```
git clone https://github.com/yuki/myVault.git
cd myVault
git submodule update --init deps/editor.md
python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then go to your browser to http://localhost:8000

> This is just for developing or to check it out. You should put the code behind a real web server and a **SSL certificate**

### Configuration
There's a gear in the top of the web where you can edit where's the URL of your Vault server, for example: https://my-vault.example.com:8200/v1/ If you don't configure it, by default MyVault try to connect to http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/ .
